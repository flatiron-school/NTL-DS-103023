    "We know already that $p$-values tell us (together with some $\\alpha$-threshold) *whether* differences between groups are significant; the idea now is to have a measure of *how* significant differences are.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Here](https://www.physport.org/recommendations/Entry.cfm?ID=93385) is a helpful resource. The basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can shrink $p$-values rather artificially by increasing our sample size, no matter how small the effect size between two groups. So, with a large enough sample size, we can have as small a $p$-value as we like––but it won't be an interesting result if the effect size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite difficulty is possible as well: Our $p$-value can be quite large if our sample size is small enough. And that's true even if the effect size is large."

Since $\\beta$ tells us the rate at which our tests will lead us *to fail* to reject the null hypothesis when in fact it is false, the power of a test thus tells us the rate at which our tests lead us to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

    "## Part 5. Limitations of Cohen's $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the story we told back in Part 1? It went like this: For a given effect size, we can shrink our $p$-value by increasing our sample size or inflate our $p$-value by decreasing our sample size. But the trouble with this story is that it assumes that effect size is independent of sample size. This, at least if we are measuring effect size in terms of Cohen's $d$, is false, since that metric depends on the standard deviation, which, in turn, depends on sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if we had access to the population parameters, then we could calculate Cohen's $d$ on those and this worry would effectively vanish. But in practice we do not have access to these, and so we are in the familiar position of estimating these based on samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/04/04/dbias/) is a nice resource on this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic upshot is this: Cohen's $d$, when calculated on samples, tends to **overestimate** the true effect size of a difference between populations (because population standard deviations are often larger than sample standard deviations), **especially** for small sample sizes. So: If your sample sizes are relatively small, take Cohen's $d$ with a grain of salt––or use some more robust metric of effect size.\n",
